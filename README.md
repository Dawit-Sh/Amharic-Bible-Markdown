# Amharic Bible In Markdown

The title is pretty descriptive but this is the bible in Amharic with a markdown format

## Why

I created this to aid with my bible study in my note taking app, i usually prefer note taking in markdown and citing the english one seemed a but 
odd so i decided to get the amharic bible in markdown, looked around couldn't find it so got myself one

## How 

How it was created was pretty simple. since the bible existed at the [wordproject](https://www.wordproject.org/) all i had to do was navigate to the download
section and grab the amharic copy. After that i was a matter of writting 3 shell scripts which i will add alongside if anyone wants to check.
1) to convert all html to markdown in each directory using pandoc 
2) clear out the residual links from the html 
3) clear out some niche stuff left of the link clearing 

## Usage

1. clone the directory 
2. move the bible folder to your notes folder 
3. enjoy 

## Credits
this would not have been possible without [መጽሐፍ ቅዱስ The Holy Bible in the Amharic language with audio narration](https://www.wordproject.org/bibles/am/index.htm)
